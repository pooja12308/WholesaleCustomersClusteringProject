 Wholesale customers Data Set | Kaggle
Annual spending in monetary units of clients of a wholesale distributor
 
Business Scenario
A wholesale distributor supplies products to different types of clients such as:
Retail stores
Cafés
Hotels
Restaurants
Currently, all customers are treated the same, which leads to:
Inefficient inventory planning
Poor marketing strategies
Missed upselling opportunities
The company wants to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to improve decision-making.
 
-------------------------------------------
🔹 Task 1: Data Exploration
Load the dataset and inspect all available features.
Identify which columns represent customer purchasing behavior.
Remove or ignore columns that are not directly related to spending patterns.
🔹 Task 2: Feature Selection
Select suitable numerical features that can represent customer buying habits.
Justify your feature selection briefly.
🔹 Task 3: Data Preparation
Prepare the selected data so that distance-based grouping works correctly.
Verify that all features contribute fairly to distance calculation.
🔹 Task 4: Clustering Model Construction
Build a clustering model to group customers into K segments.
Experiment with multiple values of K.
🔹 Task 5: Optimal Cluster Identification
Identify a suitable number of customer groups using an appropriate approach.
Explain why this value of K is reasonable.
🔹 Task 6: Cluster Assignment
Assign each customer to a cluster.
Add the cluster label to the dataset.
🔹 Task 7: Cluster Visualization
Visualize customer clusters using two important spending categories.
Mark cluster centers clearly in the visualization.
🔹 Task 8: Cluster Profiling
For each cluster:
Calculate average spending per category
Identify dominant purchase patterns
Summarize each cluster in business-friendly language.
🔹 Task 9: Business Insight Generation
Propose one business strategy for each customer segment, such as:
Targeted promotions
Inventory prioritization
Personalized pricing strategies
🔹 Task 10: Stability & Limitations
Rerun clustering with a different random state.
Observe whether cluster assignments change.
Mention one limitation of this clustering approach.
